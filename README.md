# Scalable-L2O

Implementation of ECCV 2022 paper Scalable Learning to Optimize: A Learned Optimizer Can Train Big Models. 

## Environment

We recommend using Anaconda to manage the virtual environment. 

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate sl2o
```

## Experiments

### CNNs
#### Subspaces

We provide pre-generated subspaces for models in this [link]. Optionally, one can generate the subspaces by themselves. Please refer to the `subspaces` directory for more details. 

#### Meta-Training

ResNet-18
```bash

```
